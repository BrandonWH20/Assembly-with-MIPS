Lab 5: Subroutines
CMPE 012 Winter 2019
Holcombe, Brandon

-------------------------
What was your design approach?
Copy and paste all comments from the lab pdf, then just work on each 
section. It helped to write out what the inputs and outputs should be. Using a whiteboard helped me 
connect ideas from the diagram. As for debugging, havig comments on nearly every line 
helped give me a better idea 

What did you learn in this lab?
All about encyption! and how far off you can be if you type the wrong key. 
Also that it is important to clear strings, when a program can be run again without
ever being closed. 

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found
enjoyable?
Plenty of issues, at first I attempted to check for new line chars but that
ran into so many issues when printing out the strings, so that was a good 2 hours 
spent figuring it all out. Also word aligning was causing me to skip printing certain strings

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
This was actually the best lab, it clearly stated the expected methods, as well as the 
input and out that each method should have. 

Did you collaborate with anyone on this lab? Please list who you collaborated
with and the nature of your collaboration. 
Collaborated with Daniel Kaplun, Mark Kudryavtsev. The nature of our collaboration was discussing test cases.
