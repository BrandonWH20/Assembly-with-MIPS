LAB 1: Intro to Logic Simulation
CMPE 012 Winter 2019
Holcombe, Brandon

-------------------------
What did you learn in this lab?
I learned basic Logic circuits, and how to design more complex functions using them 
Also, learned Truth Tables, and how to go from a truth table to an Equation. 
Using that equation and simple Boolean ALgebra to simplify the equation. 
Finally implenting that equation into a function Logic circuit. 

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
Writting out a plan, then testing it in smaller chunks was easier to
debug. Issues were much harder to sove in C/1&2. It really came down to 
checking that everything was identical to the original plan. 

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
Using a program that works with both MAC OS and Windows would make 
things much more convienent.
