-------------------------
What were the learning objectives of this lab?
The objective of this lab is to apply the knowledge presented in class by building
more complex circuits using combinational and sequential logic. 

What was your design approach?
My design approach was writting the program like I would Java. 
This helped with understanding exactly what the next step is, and 
how it should change the result of the previous step.
builder a working register, then the hit logic, then the adder and finally 2's compliment. 

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found
enjoyable?
SO many issues. It was really difficult coming up with ways to express 
if else statements with gates. and the 2's compliment to display logic was the worst

How would you redesign this lab assignment to make it better?
More exaples similiar to the flip flop file. using muxes and alu's. 
While neither would be counted, it would have helped with an understanding of the 
logic and the application of them
