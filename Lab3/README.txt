The text of your prompts are stored in the processorâ€™s memory. After
assembling your program, what is the range of addresses in which these strings
are stored?
0x10010000 - 0x10010038

What were the learning objectives of this lab?
Introduction to MIPS Assembly, covering basic input, output and formating. 

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found
enjoyable?
As usual, lots of issues. for the first 4 hours of this lab, I did not realize j $ra was a function. So it seemed completely hopeless. Creating functions that eventually grew from basic assembly instructions and getting to a point where it seemed like I was writting my own very simple programing language was cool. It really helped to write it out in java, and then try to do a line for line copy. That wasn't always easy, but it made trouble shooting and defining function scope much easier. 

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
The requirment to ommit the EOL on the last triangle, seemed tedious and unnecessary. 

Did you collaborate with anyone on this lab? Please list who you collaborated
